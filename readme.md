# lcc frontend toolkit [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lccgov/lcc_frontend_toolkit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lccgov/lcc_frontend_toolkit)
A collection of Sass and JavaScript files to be used by Leeds City Council frontend applications.

To publish a new [NPM version of the toolkit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lcc_frontend_toolkit), bump the version in the VERSION.txt file.  This will kick off a [Travis CI build](https://travis-ci.org/lccgov/lcc_frontend_toolkit_npm), which will publish the updated package to the NPM registry.
